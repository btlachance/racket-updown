# racket-updown

*Towards a Rackety implementation of Amin and Rompf's λ↑↓*

This implementation-in-progress is a way for me to learn about their
core language, what it's like to extend it (with effects as the first
planned extension), and to play with specialization in a broad
sense. Maybe it can even some day interoperate nicely with Racket
programs.
